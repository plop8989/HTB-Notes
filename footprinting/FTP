---FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL---
  FTP runs in the application layer of TCP/IP protocol stack
    so it runs in the same layer as HTTP or POP.
  FTP establishes client/server connections through TCP port 21
    Then both participants establish the data channel via TCP
    port 20. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission.
    
    FTP is either ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
    
    ACTIVE: client makes connection on TCP 21 & tells the server which
      client side port the server can send its responses. However,
      if a firewall protects the client, the server cant reply as
      all external connections are blocked. This is why there is a 
      passive mode
    
    PASSIVE: server announces a port where the client can establish
      the data channel. Since the client starts the connection, the
      firewall doesn't block it.
  USUALLY WE NEED CREDENTIALS TO USE FTP. IT IS ALSO A CLEAR-TEXT
    PROTOCOL SO SOMETIMES IT CAN BE SNIFFED IF CONDITIONS ON THE 
    NETWORK ARE RIGHT.
  Sometimes a server offers anonymous FTP where the user may
    upload or download files with FTP without a password.
    Due to the associated security risks of public FTP, options
    for the users are usally limited.

  ---TFTP---
    Trivial File Transfer Protocol(TFTP) is simpler than FTP and
      transfers files between client and server processes.
    It doesn't provide user authentication
    TFTP uses UDP making it unreliable
