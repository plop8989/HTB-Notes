---DOMAIN INFORMATION---
  Domain info isn't just about the subdomains but rather the
    entire presence on the internet.
  
  This info is gathered PASSIVELY WITHOUT DIRECT/ACTIVE SCANS
  
  When passively gatherng info we can use third-party services
  
  to better understand the company.
  The first thing we should do is scrutinize/closely examin the
    main website
  
  For example, many IT companies offer app development, IoT,
    hosting, data science, etc depending on their industry.
    If we encounter a service we have little knowledge of we should 
    gain an understanding of it. We should see what it deals with
    and what opportunities it can give us and see how the company
    is structured.
  
  "What do we see and what do we not see?". We see services but not
    their functionality. Services are bound to technical aspects
    needed to provide service. We should take a developer's point
    of view to gain a tecnical insight into the functionality.
