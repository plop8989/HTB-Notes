---DOMAIN INFORMATION---
  Domain info isn't just about the subdomains but rather the
    entire presence on the internet.
  
  This info is gathered PASSIVELY WITHOUT DIRECT/ACTIVE SCANS
  
  When passively gatherng info we can use third-party services
  
  to better understand the company.
  The first thing we should do is scrutinize/closely examin the
    main website
  
  For example, many IT companies offer app development, IoT,
    hosting, data science, etc depending on their industry.
    If we encounter a service we have little knowledge of we should 
    gain an understanding of it. We should see what it deals with
    and what opportunities it can give us and see how the company
    is structured.
  
  "What do we see and what do we not see?". We see services but not
    their functionality. Services are bound to technical aspects
    needed to provide service. We should take a developer's point
    of view to gain a tecnical insight into the functionality.
   

   ---ONLINE PRESENCE---
    Example: A medium sized company hired us to test their entire
      infastructure. The first point of internet presence could be
      an SSL CERTIFICATE on the main site.
    SSL CERTIFICATES often contain multiple subdomains. This means
      it is likely used fo rseveral domains and they are still active.
    We can go to sites lke CRT.SH to find more subdomains. They use
      CERTIFICATE TRANSPARENCY LOGS
    SHODAN can be used to find devices/systems permantly connected to
      the internet like IoT deviced


---CLOUD RESOURCES---
  Most common used cloud services are AWS, GCP, and Azure.
  These are good but not free from vulnerabilities, most commonly
    due to misconfigurations. S3 Buckets (AWS), Blobs (Azure), 
    Cloud Storage (GCP), can be accessed without authentication
    if configured incorrectly
  An easy way to try and find cloud storage of websites is with 
    GOOGLE DORKS inurl: & intext:. 
    Suppose the company's name is "inline":
      ---SEARCH FOR AWS---
      intext: inline inurl: amazonaws.com
      ---SEARCH FOR AZURE---
      intext: inline inurl: blob.core.windows.net
  We may also find these links the the page's source code
  Sites like DOMAIN.GLASS can also tell us a lot about the 
    infastructure.
  DOMAIN.GLASS may also show a CLOUDFLARE SECURITY ASSESSMENT status.
    If it says safe or unsafe or etc we can note this for the
      second layer (gateway)
  Another tool is GRAYHATWARFARE. It has many features. It can discover
    AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud storage, and filter by file format.
    Therefore once we had found them through google we can also search
    for them on GrayHatWarefare and discover what files are stored on 
    the cloud storage.
