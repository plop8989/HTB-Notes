---THE GOAL IS NOT TO GET INTO THE SYSTEMS BUT TO FIND
      ---ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GET THERE---

---NOTABLE PRINCIPLES---
  1. There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view
  2. Distinguish between what we see and what we don't see.
  3. There are always more ways to gain more info. Understand the target


---ENUMERATION PRINCIPLES---
  OSINT and ENUMERATION should be done seperately because
    osing is based only on passive info gathering and
    doesn't involve active enumeration of a target.
  Enumeration is a LOOP where we repeatedly gather info
    based on date we have or have previously discovered.
  Once we have identified the infastructure we need to examine
    individual services and protocols.
  ---QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ANSWER---
    What can we see?
    Why are we able to see it?
    What image does the info create for us?
    What do we gain from it?
    How can we use it?
    What can't we see?
    Why can't we see it?
    What image does the unknown create for us?
