  Evasion Lab Hard 


--PENTEST NOTES---
  During internal pentests we are often provided with an IP list


---HOST DISCOVERY---
  Some firewalls don't allow scans and evasive techniques are needed
  First step is to determine if the host is alive. By disabling port scanning 
      nmap automatically pings the host with ICMP echo requests. If the host is alive
      we will get the same type of ping as a reply.
  We can also achieve the same result using --reason.
  Nmap will also determin if the host is alive using ARP pings.
  ARP pinging can be disabled and ICMP can be used instead


---PORT STATES---
  Open:    Indicates the connection to the port has been established. 
				      These can be TCP , UDP datagrams , SCTP associations
  Closed:    Indicates the packet we received has an RST flag
  Filtered:    Nmap cannot identify whether the port is open or closed 
				         due to either an error code or no response				
  Unfiltered: This state only occurs during a TCP-ACK scan. Port is accessible, 
				         but cannot be determined if its open or closed.
  Open | Filtered:	If a port doesn't give us a response, Nmap will set it to that state. 
				        Indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
  Closed | Filtered:	This only occurs in  IP ID Idle scans. Indicates it was impossible to determine if the
				 port is closed or filtered by a firewall.

---SERVICE ENUMERATION---
  We need to determine the application and its version as 
    accurately as possible so we can look for known exploits

  ---USES---
    An initial quick port scan is useful to see available ports
    This causes less traffic which is good as otherwise the 
      security mechanisms can discover and block us
  
  ---BANNER GRABBING---
    After a completed 3-way handshake, the server often sends
      a banner for indentification to let the client know what 
      service its working with. This is a PSH flag in the TCP
      header. Sometimes its not immediately provided or 
      the info can be removed or manipulated.
    We can manually connect to the SMTP server with NC, grab
      the banner, and intercept the network traffic using TCPDUMP,
      we can see what Nmap didnt show us.
      TCPDUMP: sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host <our ip> and <target ip>
      Netcat: nc -nv <target ip>

---SCRIPTING ENGINE---
  The scripting engine (NSE) allows for the use of lua 
    scripts in nmap.
  Scripts can be defined in several ways 
    Default scripts: -sC
    Specific category: --script <category>
    Defined scripts: --script <name>

---PERFORMANCE---
  DURING BLACK BOX pentests we don't have all the info to optimize a scan.
    Nmap has six different timing templates (-T <0-5>). These determine the aggressiveness
    of our scans.
  BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE CAN LEAD TO SECURITY SYSTEMS BLOCKING US
  T0 is the slowest and "stealthiest" and T5 is the fastest and least stealthy

---FIREWALL & IDS/IPS EVASION---
  IDS (intrusion detection system)
  IPS (intrusion prevention system)
  A port can be filtered for multiple reasons, in some cases firewalls are set to handle 
    specific connections. The packets are either dropped or rejected.
  DROPPED PACKETS ARE IGNORED WITH NO RESPONS TO SENT BACK BUT REJECTED PACKETS ARE 
    SENT BACK TO US WITH AN RST FLAG
  These packets have different ICMP error codes or contain nothing at all:
    Net Unreachable
    Net prohibited
    Host Unreachable
    Host Prohibited
    Port Unreachable
    Proto Unreachable
  ---TACTICS---
    TCP-ACK scans (-sA) is much harder for firewalls & IDS/IPS to filer
      compared to SYN(-sS) or Connect Scans(sT) as (-sA) only send a TCP
      packet with an ACK flag
    Its usefule to have several virtual private servers (VPS) with different IP addresses 
      to determine if the target is running IDS/IPS systems and a firewall
    One way to determine this is to scan from a single host (VPS) and it becomes blocked 
      by the target we know the admin has taken security measures
      THIS TELLS US WE NEED TO BE QUIETER/STEALTHIER WITH OUR SCANS
  ---DECOYS---
    If there is a chance at being blocked, we should use the Decoy Scanning Method (-D).
      With (-D), Nmap creates random IP addrs and inserts them into the IP header of the 
      sent packets. We can use (RND: X) to create X amount of decoys and our real IP is
      placed somewhere between the decoys.
  ---DNS PROXYING---
    Nmap performs reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified. DNS queries are made
      over UPD port 53 and TCP port 53.
    Nmap allows us to specify DNS servers ourselves which is fundamental if we are in a DMZ
    The company's DNS servers are usually trusted more than random ones from the internet. 
      We could use them to interact with hosts on the internal network. We can also use TCP
      port 53 as the source port (--source-port). If the firewall controls this port and 
      doesn't filter IDS/IPS properly, the TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.
