---PICKUP AT---
  Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion


--PENTEST NOTES---
  During internal pentests we are often provided with an IP list


---HOST DISCOVERY---
  Some firewalls don't allow scans and evasive techniques are needed
  First step is to determine if the host is alive. By disabling port scanning 
      nmap automatically pings the host with ICMP echo requests. If the host is alive
      we will get the same type of ping as a reply.
  We can also achieve the same result using --reason.
  Nmap will also determin if the host is alive using ARP pings.
  ARP pinging can be disabled and ICMP can be used instead


---PORT STATES---
  Open:    Indicates the connection to the port has been established. 
				      These can be TCP , UDP datagrams , SCTP associations
  Closed:    Indicates the packet we received has an RST flag
  Filtered:    Nmap cannot identify whether the port is open or closed 
				         due to either an error code or no response				
  Unfiltered: This state only occurs during a TCP-ACK scan. Port is accessible, 
				         but cannot be determined if its open or closed.
  Open | Filtered:	If a port doesn't give us a response, Nmap will set it to that state. 
				        Indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
  Closed | Filtered:	This only occurs in  IP ID Idle scans. Indicates it was impossible to determine if the
				 port is closed or filtered by a firewall.

---SERVICE ENUMERATION---
  We need to determine the application and its version as 
    accurately as possible so we can look for known exploits

  ---USES---
    An initial quick port scan is useful to see available ports
    This causes less traffic which is good as otherwise the 
      security mechanisms can discover and block us
  
  ---BANNER GRABBING---
    After a completed 3-way handshake, the server often sends
      a banner for indentification to let the client know what 
      service its working with. This is a PSH flag in the TCP
      header. Sometimes its not immediately provided or 
      the info can be removed or manipulated.
    We can manually connect to the SMTP server with NC, grab
      the banner, and intercept the network traffic using TCPDUMP,
      we can see what Nmap didnt show us.
      TCPDUMP: sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host <our ip> and <target ip>
      Netcat: nc -nv <target ip>

---SCRIPTING ENGINE---
  The scripting engine (NSE) allows for the use of lua 
    scripts in nmap.
  Scripts can be defined in several ways 
    Default scripts: -sC
    Specific category: --script <category>
    Defined scripts: --script <name>

---PERFORMANCE---
  DURING BLACK BOX pentests we don't have all the info to optimize a scan.
    Nmap has six different timing templates (-T <0-5>). These determine the aggressiveness
    of our scans.
  BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE CAN LEAD TO SECURITY SYSTEMS BLOCKING US
  T0 is the slowest and "stealthiest" and T5 is the fastest and least stealthy

---ARGUMENTS---

  -sn: Disables port scanning
  -iL: Scans against addresses in a hosts list [sudo nmap x y z -iL hosts.txt]
  -oA: Outputs results to specified file [sudo nmap x y z -oA host.txt]
  -PE: Performs scan using ICMP Echo Requests against the target
  --packet-trace: Shows all packets sent and received
  --reason: Displays the reason for a specific result
  --disable-arp-ping
  --stats-every=Xs: shows scan stats every X seconds
  -v / -vv: shows open ports directly when they are detected
  -A: Aggressive scan that uses -sV -O --traceroute and default
      NSE scritps.
  --Vuln: uses scripts from the vulnerabilitie scanner category
  -F: Scans top 100 ports
