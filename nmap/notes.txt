  Service Enumeration


---SERVICE ENUMERATION---
  We need to determine the application and its version as 
    accurately as possible so we can look for known exploits

  ---USES---
    An initial quick port scan is useful to see available ports
    This causes less traffic which is good as otherwise the 
      security mechanisms can discover and block us
  
  ---BANNER GRABBING---
    After a completed 3-way handshake, the server often sends
      a banner for indentification to let the client know what 
      service its working with. This is a PSH flag in the TCP
      header. Sometimes its not immediately provided or 
      the info can be removed or manipulated.
    We can manually connect to the SMTP server with NC, grab
      the banner, and intercept the network traffic using TCPDUMP,
      we can see what Nmap didnt show us.
      TCPDUMP: sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host <our ip> and <target ip>
      Netcat: nc -nv <target ip>


---SCRIPTING ENGINE---
  The scripting engine (NSE) allows for the use of lua 
    scripts in nmap.
  Scripts can be defined in several ways 
    Default scripts: -sC
    Specific category: --script <category>
    Defined scripts: --script <name>


---ARGUMENTS---
  
  --stats-every=Xs: shows scan stats every X seconds
  -v / -vv: shows open ports directly when they are detected
  -A: Aggressive scan that uses -sV -O --traceroute and default
      NSE scritps.
  --Vuln: uses scripts from the vulnerabilitie scanner category
