---CONNECTING TO SPECIFIC PORTS IN NETCAT---

on way is with the command: nc -nv -s -p53 X.X.X.X 5000

this attempts to connect to the port 5000 on the target x.x.x.x
  -n says dont do a dns lookup and just connect to the ip address
  -v says provide as much info as netcat cat
  -s specifies the source ip address
